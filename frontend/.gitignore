Your .gitignore file is used to tell Git which files and directories to ignore in your repository. The files and folders listed are typically:

- Automatically generated (like node_modules, build, coverage)
- Environment-specific (like .env files)
- System files (like .DS_Store)
- Log files

You should ignore these because:

- They are not needed in version control.
- They can be large or contain sensitive information.
- They can be regenerated or are specific to your local environment.

This keeps your repository clean, secure, and easier to manage.
